Ratioboss simulates data download and upload in order to boost your ratio
on BitTorrent trackers. No data actually flows between you and other peers,
thus data usage is marginal. Be aware that aside from the transfer speeds
being randomized, no attempts are made at avoiding detection;
it is therefore recommended to point this tool at popular torrents.

Here is an example of a ratioboss session set up to download a file
at 5 MiB/s and upload at 2 MiB/s:

	$ ratioboss -down 5M -up 2M foo.torrent
	9:31PM Torrent name: Foo
	9:31PM Torrent size: 8.80 GiB
	9:31PM Announce: 0.00 B downloaded, 0.00 B uploaded
	9:31PM Next announce: 10:31PM
	10:31PM Announce: 8.80 GiB downloaded, 2.64 GiB uploaded
	10:31PM Next announce: 11:31PM
	^C10:45PM Quitting...
	10:46PM Announce: 8.80 GiB downloaded, 4.83 GiB uploaded
